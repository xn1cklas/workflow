/**
 * v4 event endpoints: fully framed wire protocol.
 *
 * Both directions use the same length-prefixed binary frame layout:
 *
 *   frame := [u32_be meta_len][cbor_meta][u32_be body_len][body_bytes]
 *
 * - **POST**: request body is one frame. `cbor_meta` carries structured
 *   event metadata (eventType, specVersion, deploymentId, workflowName,
 *   …, executionContext); `body_bytes` is the opaque user payload that
 *   the server stores without ever decoding it.
 * - **GET single event**: response body is one frame.
 * - **LIST events**: response body is a stream of frames terminated by a
 *   sentinel frame (meta = `{_end: 1, next?: cursor, hasMore: boolean}`).
 *
 * Requests carry special HTTP response headers (eventId / runId / createdAt)
 * for client convenience, to allow metadata access without decoding the body.
 *
 * Higher-level callers (the world-vercel adapter) CBOR-encode their JS
 * values into the `payload` parameter and CBOR-decode returned `body`
 * bytes. This module stays at the wire-bytes layer.

/**
 * Issue an instrumented v4 request through the global `fetch`, NOT undici's

 *
 * Vercel's observability "outgoing requests" view instruments the global
 * `fetch`. Calling `undici.request()` directly bypasses that instrumentation,
 * so v4 event traffic disappeared from the log viewer while queue traffic
 * (which uses `fetch`) kept showing. `instrumentedFetch` routes through the
 * global `fetch` with the custom dispatcher, restoring visibility while also
 * opening the OpenTelemetry client span, injecting trace context, setting the
 * cache-bust header (see #618), and emitting `DEBUG` logs. This is the same
 * envelope the v3 `makeRequest` path has always had.
 *
 * The events API uses its own HTTP/2-enabled dispatcher
 * (`getEventsDispatcher`): these reads/writes are plain request/response (or a
 * streamed LIST response) and benefit from multiplexing. The default dispatcher
 * stays on HTTP/1.1 because H2 deadlocks the queue's webhook respondWith
 * mechanism. See http-client.ts.
 *
 * No per-request timeout: a LIST response streams the full event-log page, which
 * for a large run can legitimately take a while to drain, so a whole-request
 * deadline would abort it mid-stream.

 * it. A frame multiplexed onto a shared socket makes no `fetch` call and
 * produces no `Response`, so that span disappeared when the transport
 * flipped, and with it the per-event view of a run's writes, which is the
 * thing a trace of a step execution is mostly made of.
 *
 * Nothing about the request/response *semantics* changed, though: one frame out,
 * one correlated reply back, one status. So the span is synthesized here with
 * the same name, kind and attributes the fetch path emits, over the v4 REST
 * endpoint the server forwards the frame into. Two consequences that are the
 * point rather than a side effect:
 *
 *   - a trace looks the same either side of `WORKFLOW_EVENTS_TRANSPORT`, so the
 *     A/B the flag exists for compares like with like, and
 *   - dashboards keyed on `http POST` + `url.full` keep working unchanged.
 *
 * What is *not* elided: `workflow.events.transport: 'ws'`,
 * `network.protocol.name: 'websocket'` and `workflow.events.ws.url` say plainly
 * that no HTTP request was issued, and `workflow.events.ws.req_id` is the join
 * key to the server's log line for the same frame. A synthetic span that hid
 * which transport produced it would be a trap, not a convenience.
 *
 * Two things the HTTP envelope has that this one deliberately does not: the
 * cache-bust header (a frame is memoized by nothing) and a per-frame
 * `traceparent` (frames carry no headers; trace context rides the upgrade
 * instead, so the server parents to the connection's span, not to this one).
 *
 * One gap this cannot close: Vercel's observability *outgoing requests* view is
 * built by instrumenting the global `fetch`, not by reading OpenTelemetry spans,
 * so WS event writes stay absent from it however faithful the span is. Traces
 * get the writes back; that view needs a real request, which is the transport's
 * whole point to avoid.
