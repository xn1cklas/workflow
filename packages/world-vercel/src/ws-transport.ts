/**
 * Client half of the events WebSocket protocol. The normative wire-format and
 * lifecycle spec is the server's `docs/ws-protocol.md`.
 *
 * One socket per `wsUrl` (which embeds the runId) is shared across concurrent
 * `createWorkflowRunEventV4` calls and multiplexed by `reqId`. Frame meta is
 * `{ reqId, type, ... }`, with the type-specific payload nested under a field
 * named after `type` (only `event` is sent today). The caller builds the meta;
 * this file owns the socket and the reqId<->promise bookkeeping.
 *
 * Every failure mode has to reach the caller waiting on it: a swallowed error
 * here is a hung invocation, not a lost log line. Whether a failed write is
 * re-sent is `event-retry.ts`'s decision, not this file's: `WsTransportError`
 * is mapped to the same `code: 'TRANSPORT'` shape a failed `fetch` produces.
 *
 * Uses the `ws` package rather than the WHATWG global `WebSocket`, which cannot
 * set headers on the upgrade request; auth rides the handshake, once per
 * connection instead of once per message.
 *
 * Transport *selection* lives at the bottom of the file (the opt-in flag,
 * which Worlds can hold a socket at all, and the pre-warm entry point) so
 * `events-v4.ts` consumes one seam instead of assembling the transport.

 *
 * Call it as early in an invocation as the run id is known, as the flow route
 * does before dispatching to the runtime. Only worth it for a caller that will
 * write
 * several events: a single write does not repay a handshake, which is why
 * `start()` deliberately doesn't open one for `run_created`.
 *
 * Silent and synchronous by contract: `undefined` on the HTTP default and on a
 * World that can't hold a socket, and it neither awaits nor reports the
 * connect. Callers must be able to treat it as free.
 *
 * An open socket is not `unref`'d, so a caller that drops the release stops the
 * process exiting (and keeps a server invocation pinned, one per connection)
 * until the platform kills it. The socket drops once every concurrent holder
 * has released; see `WsEventsTransport.release`.
 *
 * **The release closes over the instance, never the URL.** A channel is evicted
 * from `transports` the moment it closes, and a refused upgrade does that on
 * the connect path, so the next opener for the same run gets a *different*
 * instance under the same URL. A release that re-resolved the URL would
 * decrement whichever instance is registered by then rather than the one it
 * claimed, dropping a socket a live invocation is still writing over, and for
 * the event types `EVENT_RETRY_ELIGIBILITY` marks non-retryable there is no
 * second attempt to carry that write over HTTP. Idempotent for the same reason:
 * a doubled release must not consume another holder's claim.
 *
 * Synchronous matters beyond cost. Two invocations for one run share a channel,
 * so an open races a release whenever the refcount stands at 1, and because
 * neither yields between its map lookup and its refcount write, the release
 * either observes the open's increment, and the socket survives for the new
 * holder, or lands first, and the opener misses the de-registered instance and
 * builds a fresh channel. Adding an await ahead of the refcount write (minting
 * a token to derive the URL, say) reopens that window, and an open landing
 * inside it hits an already-closed instance, returns early, and leaves that
 * invocation on HTTP for its whole duration with nothing to signal it.
