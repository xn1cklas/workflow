     *   error: a run that is still running is a legitimate answer.

     *   implementation MAY resolve earlier with a non-terminal snapshot. For
     *   example, `@workflow/world-vercel` does when the backend it is talking
     *   to has no long-poll route and it degrades to a plain read. Callers
     *   must therefore pace their own retries rather than assume one call per
     *   `timeoutMs` (the runtime's `Run#pollReturnValue` keeps consecutive
     *   non-terminal observations at least one poll interval apart).
     * - **Fail exactly like `get`.** A missing run throws

     * (`world-postgres` uses `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`, `world-local` an in-process

   *   complete log from a truncated one by its length.
   * - **Bump and report.** A create never fails because its requested slot is
   *   taken. The World advances to the next free slot, commits there, and
   *   returns the events occupying the slots it skipped over on the success
   *   response (see {@link EventResult.events}). The writer learns its
   *   snapshot was stale without the write being rejected, which is why no
   *   World needs a precondition guard.
   *
   * Allocating at the commit is what makes a reader's log a *prefix* of the
   * run's log rather than a prefix with a hole in it. A World that hands a
   * position out earlier, and can therefore let an event land behind one a
   * reader has already passed, breaks the property every replay depends on.
