/**
 * QuickJS WebAssembly (WASM) VM integration with the Workflow DevKit.
 *
 * This module provides the entry point for running workflows in the
 * QuickJS VM engine instead of the `node:vm` engine. Both engines
 * implement the same event-replay execution model, where every invocation:
 *
 * 1. Loads the full event log for the run
 * 2. Runs the workflow function from the top in a fresh QuickJS VM,
 *    replaying the event log to resolve awaited primitives
 * 3. On suspension: creates events + queues steps for new pending ops
 * 4. On completion: creates run_completed
 * 5. On failure: creates run_failed

 * Run a workflow using the QuickJS WASM VM engine.

 *
 * Log position on writes. This engine follows the same rule as the node:vm
 * replay loop for which writes tell the World where the writer stood (see the
 * "Who names a position" table above `slotSnapshotParams` in `helpers.ts`):
 *
 * - Writes made from this invocation's view of the log (`step_created`,
 *   `wait_created`, `hook_created`, `hook_disposed`, `attr_set`, the abort
 *   `hook_received`, `wait_completed`, and the `step_created` + `step_failed`
 *   pair for an unserializable input) carry `eventCount`, and the page a
 *   World hands back is queued for the live VM through {@link QuickJSLogView}.
 * - A single inline step's terminal write asks for the inline delta
 *   (`sinceCursor`) through `executeStep`, and so does a lone `hook_created`
 *   (see `dispatchPendingOps.deltaCursor`); the delta is queued the same
 *   way. The step executor's other writes carry nothing: it holds no log.
 * - Run-terminal writes (`run_completed`, `run_failed`) and the terminal drain
 *   of pending ops carry nothing: nothing reads the log afterwards.
 *
 * What differs from the node engine is what "merge into the log" means. The
 * node engine merges a returned page into the array it replays from. This
 * engine holds a live VM that consumes events exactly once, in position
 * order, so a returned page is queued and delivered ahead of the next
 * `events.list`, which then only runs when the queue cannot account for the
 * next position. Both engines fall back to a list for anything a page did
 * not carry.

  // ---- Inline continuation loop ----
  //
  // While the workflow is suspended, this loop keeps the VM alive and
  // makes as much forward progress as possible within one invocation:
  //
  //   1. Dispatch durable side effects for the suspension's pending ops
  //      (step_created / hook_created / attr_set / wait_created /
  //      hook_received for aborts) and complete elapsed waits.
  //   2. Feed all newly recorded events (attr_set, hook_created, elapsed
  //      wait_completed, terminals written by concurrent invocations, ...)
  //      into the LIVE VM via session.continueWithEvents, resuming
  //      execution exactly where it left off, no fresh-VM re-replay.
  //      Cheap progress is fed BEFORE running step bodies so promise
  //      chains that are not gated on steps (hook.getConflict(),
  //      setAttributes(), racing sleeps) advance first and can surface
  //      additional pending steps for the same inline batch.
  //   3. Once no cheap progress remains, execute up to
  //      getMaxInlineSteps() steps created by THIS invocation inline (no
  //      queue round-trip), in parallel, with the replay budget paused
  //      during step bodies, mirroring the node:vm engine's inline
  //      replay loop. Overflow and retry/throttled steps are queued for
  //      background execution. A delayed wait-continuation message is
  //      enqueued for the soonest pending wait first, so racing timers
  //      fire on time (in a separate invocation) while step bodies block
  //      this one.
  //
  // The loop exits when the workflow settles, no forward progress is
  // possible in-process, the replay budget is exhausted, or the run is
  // gone.
