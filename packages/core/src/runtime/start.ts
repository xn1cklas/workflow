 * The spec version to stamp on a run that another deployment will execute.

 * version the target itself mints (which already honours the target's own
 * `WORKFLOW_SEALED_LOG` switch), so that is the answer, capped at what this
 * caller's World mints: the caller writes `run_created` and the arguments,
 * and must never stamp a version it could not have written itself.
 *
 * When the target does not report a usable version:
 *
 * - a plain-text reply predates the versioned JSON health response, which
 *   arrived with spec 3 (CBOR queue transport), so it is stamped as
 *   event-sourced: such a target cannot read a CBOR `runInput`.
 * - a JSON reply without a usable `specVersion` still proves the target is
 *   at spec 3 or later, so it is stamped with CBOR queue transport rather
 *   than losing it (and resilient start with it) to a malformed field.
 * - a probe that times out, or no probe channel at all, is a guess.
 *   `SPEC_VERSION_SUPPORTS_SLOT_IDENTITY` is the lowest version a v5 runtime
 *   can execute on the Vercel World (it requires slot event ids), so it is
 *   the only floor that keeps same-major targets working. It is NOT safe for
 *   an older-major target such as `stable` (spec 3): that target rejects the
 *   run when it picks it up. No single floor serves both, which is why the
 *   probe budget is generous; the miss is logged and recorded on the span.
 *
 * Once executors attest their version on `run_started` and the backend
 * raises a run to it (vercel/workflow#4366, vercel/workflow-server#1044), a
 * v5 target heals an under-stamped run, and this miss floor may drop, but
 * only once the raise is enabled on the whole server fleet AND every v5
 * target a caller can reach attests its version (a published beta that does
 * not would be stamped below slot identity and fail). Even then a floor
 * below `SPEC_VERSION_SUPPORTS_ATTRIBUTES` would refuse `attributes` on every
 * miss. Tracked in vercel/workflow#4401.
 *
 * Exported for tests.
