/**
 * The QuickJS engine's bookkeeping for the run's event log, giving that engine
 * the same relationship to a World's write responses that the node:vm replay
 * loop has.
 *
 * The node engine holds the log as an array it replays from, so a page a World
 * hands back on a write (a skipped-slot report against `eventCount`, or an
 * inline delta against `sinceCursor`; see `CreateEventParams` in
 * `@workflow/world`) is merged into that array and the next replay reads it
 * there. The QuickJS engine holds a LIVE VM instead: events are delivered to it
 * incrementally through `continueWithEvents`, in log order, exactly once. So
 * for this engine a returned page is not merged into a log; it is queued to be
 * delivered. This class owns that queue and the three numbers around it:
 *
 * - `knownMaxSlot`, the highest position this invocation has seen anywhere
 *   (fed, buffered, or its own write). Reported as `eventCount` on every write
 *   this invocation makes from its view of the log, so the World can hand
 *   back what landed above it.
 * - `fedMaxSlot`, the highest position delivered to the VM. Delivery is
 *   strictly in position order with no gaps, because the VM consumes events
 *   as they arrive and a later replay will read the log in position order;
 *   feeding position 13 before 12 exists would let the two disagree.
 * - `cursor`, the read position for `events.list`, advanced by list pages and
 *   by a complete inline delta. Alongside it, how many events of the log the
 *   cursor covers, when known: VM snapshots persist the pair, and a restore
 *   adds only the events listed after the cursor to that count.
 *
 * Only PAGES are queued for delivery, never the created event a write returns
 * on its own. A World reads a report or a delta the way it reads a listing,
 * with payload refs resolved, so those events are what a listing would have
 * delivered. The created event on a create response is not: a World may hand
 * it back with its payload still a ref descriptor and telemetry fields
 * stripped (the Vercel World does, for every type whose entity the runtime
 * does not read off the response), and a VM given that copy of a `step_failed`
 * sees a step that failed with no error in it. The created event still counts
 * toward the position the next write names; it is delivered by the page that
 * covers it or by the next listing. `deliverEvent` opts a write in when its
 * event carries nothing a VM reads (`wait_completed`).
 *
 * Positions come from slot-numbered event ids. A log whose ids are not slots
 * (a World on the old id scheme, or a mocked World) turns tracking off for the
 * rest of the invocation: no `eventCount` is sent, nothing is buffered, and the
 * engine reads the log back the way it did before any of this existed.
